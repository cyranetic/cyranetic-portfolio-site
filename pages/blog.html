  <p>When LFS is recommended online, it often states that if you want to back up large files with Git, you should use LFS.
  It neglects to say that there are times when it doesn't make sense to have large files in your project at all, and it
  neglects to say how difficult this is (especially for those newer to using git) to remove LFS tracking. Basically, LFS
  seems like an option for websites including large data files or binary files on the BACKEND. Not for photos/videos on
  the FRONTEND which will load slowly/break/disrupt UX.
