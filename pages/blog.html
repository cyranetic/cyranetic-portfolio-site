      <small>December 22, 2022</small>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Many artists use website builders such as <a href="cargo.site">Cargo</a> (targeted toward designers and artists),
        to create their portfolio websites. While Cargo does have beautiful design templates, some flexibility of design is lost, as not all code/markup is visible/editable for the user. In all fairness, of course a website builder isn't going to give away all their code. But after experiencing these limitations myself while attempting to make a Cargo site, I decided I would be
        happiest in the long run by building from scratch, since I already had HTML and CSS knowledge. If you are an
        artist who knows some basics of front-end coding and would like total control over the look and function of your
        site, it could be a fun challenge to build your site without templates, and I am aiming this article toward you. But for video
        artists especially, and to some degree artists creating static images, the question of how to efficiently host artwork in a gallery configuration can be
        confusing. For most people sharing videos online, the main concerns are ease of use and speedy loading (not video quality as much), and so for most of my online search about video hosting for artists, I was inundated with advice meant for marketers whose main concern is SEO. I recognized that there may be interest from other artists about what is best for us, so I decided to write this article. For the sake of discussing what I know best (though I always welcome any corrections if I make mistakes), I will discuss video hosting and not image hosting. I will prioritize user experience and technical frugality for artists and their audiences. I will not discuss SEO as that is a whole
        other topic that deserves its own article.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Firstly, there are many options in general for video hosting, from hosting it yourself (using HTML’s video embed element), to using remote hosts such as Youtube or
          Vimeo (<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/video-hosting">or several others</a>). While there are other video hosting platforms available,
          I will focus on the two that are most popular, Youtube and Vimeo. </p>
      <br>
      <p>When I first started coding this site, I used the HTML video tag to feature the video on the homepage. Why? My video artwork tends to have many fine details and high-speed transformations, requiring a high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate">bitrate</a> (number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time) to look nice. I knew from past experience that Youtube mangled my videos’ quality (Youtube has a lower bitrate than Vimeo when encoding, so uses more compression to make file sizes smaller), so I thought I
        could preserve the original fidelity by self-hosting, and escape all the detail-destroying video compression Youtube uses in order to handle its millions of videos. I had also briefly tried using Vimeo to upload
        the video, but I found that I couldn’t alter the appearance of playback controls, logos, etc. overlaid onto the
        video, with my free account. So I went with the HTML video tag to get the more minimal interface I wanted.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, after consulting with a knowledgeable friend, I had severe doubts and then did some reading about
        how video bitrate and resolution impact loading speed, and how website domain hosts limit bandwidth. I also realized that if I want to use version control (Git) on my site, I need to keep the site lightweight in terms of file sizes. (I don't want to go into detail, because it was a dumb rookie mistake, but do not even think about self-hosting large video files yourself and using Git LFS to store them for version control. Just don't even). So yes, version control must be taken into account. I must confess that I will always try to find a free way to do something first, and sometimes that leads me down some convoluted processes.
        In this case, it ended in defeat but with valuable lessons learned. If you just want to self-host a few shorter videos, that could be fine, but limit them to 10 seconds each and reduce the
        filesize with <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a> first. Also, consider including different video encodings in your
        code to work with different browsers, as explained in great detail <a
          href="https://marekslipek.de/workshop/videokompression/index.html">here</a> (translate to English if needed). Anyway, after reading about some video hosting platforms, I recognized that, for my video needs, if I want a good-looking and functional video interface on
        my site, I would need to pay for a service. The question now was which one to choose.</p>
        <br>
      <p>The need to strike a balance between video quality and loading speed/playback performance is an artist's number one concern,
        and it is possible to agonize in many different ways in the quest for the best performance. To go completely down this
        rabbit hole requires a great deal of time and patience and probably isn't necessary for people running relatively small sites, so I will try to put forth only
        straightforward, easily actionable solutions. For one, you can possibly “cheat” in some cases <a href="https://zhestkov.studio/">like this gorgeous example</a> by using a gif
        gallery (instead of video) on a homepage that when clicked takes you to
        another page containing just one full video. Videos take time to load to
        their full resolution, so it may be a good idea to limit or omit videos on a homepage. It makes sense to try to get
        your homepage to load fastest as it
        forms the first impression of your site for viewers, and yes, this affects your google search result rank.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As to which host I would choose between Youtube and Vimeo, the answer is clearly Vimeo.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Why Vimeo? <a href="https://www.azonetwork.com/marketing-science/blog/vimeo-vs-youtube-which-platform-is-best-for-hosting-video-content">Here</a> is a good overview comparison between
        Youtube and Vimeo
        (focused
        more towards marketers but still a well-detailed overall comparison). Because Vimeo has no ads and an array of privacy
        and embedding control options, as well as a higher bit rate to reduce the need for compression and to maintain crisp
        visual and audio quality, I recommend using Vimeo (keep in mind the free plan does not offer all these). One very valuable benefit to using Vimeo is that you can
        re-upload a video without being penalized by losing the url and video-related comments and stats. So if you
        post a video, but later find a way to optimize the quality, or even decide to make slight edits in the content, you can do that without losing any stats from the time of first posting. That's huge! Not to mention the fact that you can restrict video embedding to happening only on your
        own personal website, and add your own personal branding, making it harder for people to falsely claim your art as
        theirs. There are even “Review Tools”, helpful for sharing a private (password-protected) work-in-process video with a
        client or collaborator to get notes.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>I bought the lowest-tier paid hosting plan, which is perfect for an individual not running a large online operation, and am happy so far.
        In all fairness, though, there are a couple of drawbacks with Vimeo. For one, it will not fare as well in google search
        results as Youtube videos, as Youtube is owned by Google. For another, the cost is higher. For me, ~100USD/year is
        manageable to pay for excellent video hosting. However, if I were struggling financially, this cost
        could be outside of my reach. I truly wish that the best tech services were affordable to all, but that is
        unfortunately not the case. While I wanted to recommend the best-performing tech solutions with this article, I do not
        hesitate to say that if Youtube is your best option due to cost, use it! You can still make some edits to customize
        the interface, and it is still the best-performing video hosting service with regard to overall exposure, <em>and</em> you can
        monetize your videos. So if you can’t use Vimeo for any reason, don’t let that stop you from making the most beautiful
        website you can for your art. Your art deserves to be seen.</p>
