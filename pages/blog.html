      <h2 class="section-title">Artists Have Unique Video Hosting Needs</h2>
      <p>Many artists use websites like Cargo to create their portfolio websites. Cargo is a great option, but some flexibility
      of design is lost when working from their templates. Ability to enter the code inside a template is limited as not all
      code is visible to the user. I actually started designing and uploading content for my portfolio site with the free
      version of Cargo (i.e., not yet public), but I immediately started tweaking the code to make the site design suit my
      content better, and I soon ran into a couple of walls when I couldn’t make certain changes to the code. Some code was
      visible upon inspecting dom elements in the browser, but not in Cargo’s code editor itself. This lack of code
      transparency is to be expected with a proprietary website builder, though, and even though Cargo’s templates are really
      beautiful, I decided I would be happiest in the long run by building from scratch, since I already had HTML and CSS
      knowledge.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you are another artist who may know some basics of front-end coding and would like total control over the look and
      function of their site, it could be a fun challenge to build your site from scratch, and I am aiming this article at
      you. But for video artists especially, and to some degree artists creating static images, the question of how to host
      their art can be confusing. For the sake of discussing what I know best, I will focus this article on video hosting (but
      not live video feeds).</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are many options, from hosting it yourself (using HTML’s video tag), to using remote hosts like Youtube or
      Vimeo. You can possibly even “cheat” in some cases and use a gif (showing highlights of a video) instead of a video
      (talk about zhestkov’s site). Videos may take time to load to full resolution, so it may be a good idea to limit
      videos on a landing page, and do what Zhestkov did, providing gif links to another page with videos. It seems to make
      sense to try to get your landing page to load fastest as it forms the first impression of your site for viewers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When I first started coding, I used the HTML video tag to feature a video on the landing page of my as yet unpublished
      website. Why? I knew from past experience that Youtube mangled my art videos’ quality, so I thought I
      could preserve the original fidelity (no nasty compression! Woo!!!). I had also briefly tried using Vimeo to upload
      the video, but I found that I couldn’t alter the appearance of playback controls, logos, etc. overlaid onto the
      video with my Vimeo free account. So I went with the video tag to get that sweet minimalist interface going on my
      site. However, after consulting with a knowledgeable friend, I had severe doubts and then did some reading about
      how video bitrate and resolution impact loading speed and website domain hosts limit your bandwidth. So suddenly I
      was delving into remote hosting solutions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>First, I must admit that I will always try to find a free way to do something first. Yes, I am thrifty. But
      through reading about remote hosting platforms, I recognized that if I want a good-looking and functional video
      interface on my site, I would need to pay for a service. The question now was which one.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I must first in all transparency and mild chagrin admit that at this point I had a bit of a tussle with Git’s LFS,
      or Large File Storage. Unless you are planning to track your site’s different versions with Git, feel free to skip
      this paragraph, as my foray into LFS was simply a misadventure caused by not understanding that Git, a version
      control system, has file storage limits and I totally tried to push over 1GB(?) (it was just one video…) of file
      changes to my remote repository at Github. Yeah, you can’t do that. When my push to remote was refused, I very
      helpfully received a command line message from Git recommending the use of its LFS. Guys. I trusted Git. I trusted
      Git with my naive programmer brain. One look at the LFS website made it seem like a no-brainer, so I immediately
      started tracking my remote repo with LFS, which essentially doesn’t push your large files to the repo, just pushes
      pointers to the files which are actually stored (backed up) in LFS. But then it sadly dawned on me that having
      gotten so caught up in wanting to push my recent commits (changes in my code) to the backup, that I totally forgot
      that this in no way addresses the real issue at hand, namely that my video content was too huge for my site to
      operate decently. Impulsiveness had won again. So I decided to repent and absolve myself of the video tag of
      shame, and removed all evidence of .mp4s from my code base. With a sense of I tried pushing the current snapshot
      to my remote repo, but I got stuck in LFS limbo. It turns out that tracking with LFS is IRREVERSIBLE (I did not
      see that mentioned on their website…) and you have to do some wonky stuff with your Git tracking to be rid of
      it, stuff that again filled me with shame and a sense of incompetence. I was Atreyu in the Neverending Story,
      and my horse had just sunk into the Swamps of Sadness. However, after the curse of LFS had finally been removed
      through dishonorable means, I was once again on the road to meeting the Empress…I mean, getting my website
      online.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In short, you really shouldn’t be using Git LFS just because you have videos on your site. While LFS is I’m sure
      a good service if you have large data or binary files, I feel like a sidebar on their website, saying “Hey
      dummy! When we said large file storage, we meant for machine learning, not art!” would not be remiss. But I
      digress.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Just use Vimeo.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Why Vimeo? Youtube is free, and everyone uses it! Wellllll akshuallyyyyyy….</p>
